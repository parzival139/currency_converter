This is a currency converter mobile application which was created using React Native. 
I have used asyncstorage to save the last currency conversion and display the transaction.
The input has one text field and two dropdowns for getting the currencies for the operation.
There is a reverse button between the input and output to reverse the currencies and display the inverse values as well.
It has a clear button to reset all the values in the application and to start a new conversion.
There are few validation for checking the input conditions and if they fail then there are alerts made to indicate what errors are made.
